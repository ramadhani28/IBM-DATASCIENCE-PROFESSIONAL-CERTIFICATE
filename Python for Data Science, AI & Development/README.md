Python for Data Science, AI & Development
This project showcases foundational Python concepts I learned as part of my journey into data science, AI, and development. I began with expressions and variables, exploring arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and integer division. I learned how Python handles operands and operators, follows mathematical rules for order of operations, and allows the use of parentheses for grouping. I also discovered how to use variables to store and update values, and how meaningful variable names help make code more readable, especially when working with data.
I then moved on to working with sequences of characters in Python. I learned how to define strings using both single and double quotes, and how to access specific characters using indexing and slicing. I practiced using both positive and negative indices, used the len() function to find string lengths, and applied operations like concatenation with + and replication with *. I also gained an understanding of string immutability and how to create new strings from existing ones through manipulation.
I further explored escape sequences such as newline (\n) and tab (\t), as well as how to include literal backslashes in strings. I experimented with useful string methods like .upper(), .replace(), and .find() to transform and search within strings. These skills are especially important when working with unstructured text data in real-world data science tasks. You can explore the included lab notebooks to see practical examples of some lessons learned.
